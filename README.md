# GameJam14

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is a work in progress. The game is not in any way playable at the moment. The title of the game is also not final. We're currently just calling it GameJam14.

## Description

This is a game that started as a project for a game jam. The game jam is long over, and due to school and work it never got finished. We're now working on it in our free time, and we're hoping to get it to a playable state someday!

This project is less about the game itself, and more about the process of making it. We're using this project to learn about game development, and to have fun while doing it. We're also using it to learn about C# as well as how to plan and execute a project.

## Game Design

The game is a casual singleplayer bullet hell RPG focusing on a young bok choy named Chok, working for a business devoted to spreading light throughout the world in order to create a more habitable world for plants.

### Chok (Player)

Chock is just a regular guy. He's not very good at anything, but he's not bad at anything either. He's just... there... working his 9-5 job, paying his taxes, and living his life. He's not the hero we need, but he is the hero we deserve.

### Audience

This game is marketed to players interested in the bullet hell genre, with a relatively low level of difficulty and a greater focus on RPG elements, progression, and story. The primary focus on a low difficulty level through incremental gameplay with no penalty for going slower appeals to casual players that still want an exciting challenge, while a higher difficulty option keeps more skilled players engaged and excited.
